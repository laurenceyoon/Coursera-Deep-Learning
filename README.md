# [Coursera] Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Course can be found in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)

- Week 1:
  - Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
  - Be able to explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning.
  - Understand what are the major categories of models (such as CNNs and RNNs), and when they should be applied.
  - Be able to recognize the basics of when deep learning will (or will not) work well.

- Week 2:
  - Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network
  - Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
  - Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
  - Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
  - Become familiar with Python and Numpy
  - Work with iPython Notebooks
  - Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples
  
- Week 3:
  - Understand hidden units and hidden layers
  - Be able to apply a variety of activation functions in a neural network.
  - Build your first forward and backward propagation with a hidden layer
  - Apply random initialization to your neural network
  - Become fluent with Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
  - Build and train a neural network with one hidden layer.
  
- Week 4:
  - See deep neural networks as successive blocks put one after each other
  - Build and train a deep L-layer Neural Network
  - Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations.
  - Understand how to use a cache to pass information from forward propagation to back propagation.
  - Understand the role of hyperparameters in deep learning
